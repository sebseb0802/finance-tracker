## Overview
- This is a project that I am working on as part of my IB Diploma Programme Computer Science course for a client.
- The project will be hosted on the web for ease of access from both a laptop and a phone, and thus it will be made using a Python Django backend framework.
- The premise of the product is that it will allow the user to input various sources of income, types of expenses, and any budgets that they wish to set up.
- More specifically, when the project is complete, the client should be able to:
  - input their monthly and yearly incomes
  - input expenses
    - categorize expenses by type (e.g. entertainment, food, etc.) and by frequency (e.g. one-off, weekly, monthly, etc.)
    - view which categories of expenses are taking up the most of their monthly income
  - set up monthly and yearly budgets that are either general or category-based
    - view which categories of expenses are taking up the most of general budgets
    - be advised which categories they may wish to cut back on (through the use of email and in-app notifications)
    - be alerted, when inputting expenses, when the user has gone over their monthly, yearly, or category-based budgets
    - view these budgets as percentages of the userâ€™s monthly or yearly incomes
  - log into the web application with a username and password
    - share financial information with a spouse or relative who also have an account
  - generate monthly and yearly reports based on all of their spending in that time period
    - be advised to cut back on certain categories of spending as part of this report
    - view their spending patterns in a user-friendly manner, such as with the use of pie charts or bar graphs.
